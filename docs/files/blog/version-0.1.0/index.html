<p><em><strong>TL;DR</strong> Agora is tool for running web stores that accept Lightning Network payments for downloads. We just released a new version with lots of nice features and polish. <a href="https://github.com/agora-org/agora">Try it out</a> and <a href="https://t.me/agoradiscussion">let us know what you think</a>.</em></p>
<p>We're proud to announce the release of Agora v0.1.0. You can download it <a href="https://github.com/agora-org/agora/releases/">here</a>. Agora is a web server that allows you to host files and accept Lighting Network payments for downloads. We <a href="http://localhost:8080/files/blog/mvp.html">released an MVP a few months ago</a> with the core functionality, and since then we've been busy adding features and improving existing functionality.</p>
<p>If you have content that you'd like to sell online, or you want to run a web store for others to sell content, Agora might be for you. Our <a href="https://github.com/agora-org/agora/#readme">readme</a> is probably the best place to start learning more.</p>
<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<h3>HTTPS Support with Certificates from Let's Encrypt</h3>
<p>Agora now supports serving content over HTTPS with SSL certificates automatically fetched from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>. For this to work all you need is a domain that points to your Agora instance, no need to set up a reverse proxy or manually configure SSL certificates.</p>
<h3>Index Files</h3>
<p>If a <code>.index.md</code> file is present in a directory, it will be rendered as HTML and served along with that directory's file listing. For example, this blog post is a rendered <code>.index.md</code> file.</p>
<h3>Invoice Page Improvements</h3>
<p>We've made a number of improvements to invoice pages. Invoice pages now include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The payment request encoded as a QR code.</li>
<li>A button to copy the payment request to the clipboard.</li>
<li>A link to open the payment request in a Lightning wallet running on the same device.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Per-directory File Prices</h3>
<p>The price of files can now be set on a per-directory basis, with subdirectories inheriting the configuration of parent directories.</p>
<h3>Trophies</h3>
<p>If you'd like to support the project, or just see what it's like to buy files from an Agora instance, head to our <a href="../../trophies/index.html">trophies folder</a>, where we host a few files of our own.</p>
